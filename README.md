Project context

Used car sales are at high due to the economic inflation and cost of the new cars. The pre-owned cars market has grown tremendously over the past years and the market has grown exponentially. UrCar is a budding used car company and aims to find a good sales strategy in the market. Unlike the new cars, where prices are manufacturer determined and are controlled by governing bodies, used cars are very different beasts with huge uncertainty in both pricing and supply. Keeping this in mind, the pricing scheme of these used cars becomes important in order to grow in the market.

As a senior data scientist at UrCar, aim is to come up with a pricing model that can effectively predict the price of used cars and can help the business in devising profitable strategies using differential pricing.
